To Add Translations
---

 - All `csv`s here must be named the language code we're targeting.
 - Use `|` as the delimiter. (Easier since they text can contain commas.)
 - Column format is simply `Original|Translated`

This works by a simple text match. The file you're targeting doesn't matter. It will just change the column name/name field where possible.<br>
(This will not affect text from GMDs. Only string for files that don't have GMDs.)
